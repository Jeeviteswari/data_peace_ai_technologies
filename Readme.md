1. First I installed Python version to run python in Vs code.

2. Then for flask, I used pip install flask command for flask installation and then all is ready for my project to work on..

3. At first I create one folder name FlaskDemo.

4. In that folder, I create templates folder to integrate index.html file for flask.

5. Second I create app.py file for writing code related to all REST APIS.

6. In that file, I wrote basic flask app code and I include code for all methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods operations.

7. At last I push my code into github and submitted..
